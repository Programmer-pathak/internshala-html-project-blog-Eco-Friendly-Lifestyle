                        While people often think of sustainability as minimizing our environmental footprint, it is much broader and all-encompassing than this. Sustainable tourism is all about achieving a balance between economic growth, human well-being, and environmental health. It focuses on reducing tourism's negative impacts and on maximizing its positive benefits for communities, cultures, ecosystems, and the planet. Sustainable tourism accounts for both the immediate impacts felt today as well as those longer-term impacts that will be experienced by future generations.
                    </p>
                    <h3>1. Practice Sustainable Tourism</h3>
                    <p>
                        Increasingly, people are engaging more in sustainable tourism, which involves limiting their carbon footprint while travelling, being tactical with their spending power and helping sustain the natural environment they have the privilege to visit. <br><br>

                        This helps prevent over-tourism, which is the overcrowding of tourist destinations that disrupts the local way of life through the rise in housing and renting costs and the commodification of local traditions. <br><br>

                        Pollution, especially through excess waste, leads to the degradation of natural or archaeological sitesand the depletion of natural resources, including water, soil nutrients and biodiversity. <br>
                        <b>
                            Below are just some eco-tourism tips to consider for your next trip:-
                        </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Choose tour operators that invest in the local communities where they conduct their business</li>
                            <li>Travel off-season</li>
                            <li>Don't litter</li>
                            <li>Choose less tourist-heavy locations</li>
                            <li>Use public transport as much as possible</li>
                            <li>Stick to footpaths</li>
                            <li>Use reusable containers and bottles rather than disposable paper plates, cutlery and cups</li>
                            <li>Limit your energy use in accommodation such as by taking shorter showers, reducing air-conditioning use</li>
                            <li>Spend in local shops and restaurants</li>
                            <li>Use Environmentally Friendly Travel Products</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Limit Plane Travel</h3>
                    <p>
                        Emissions from aviation could take up one-sixth of the carbon budget remaining to limit 1.5 degrees of global warming. Within the aviation industry, options for rapid decarbonisation are slow and limited. Therefore, personally limiting flights is the best way to reduce emissions. This is until sustainable aviation has become a viable, mainstream alternative. <br><br>

                        Train travel is becoming more pleasant and economical, with new expanding train networks developing across Europe.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Avoid Cruise Holidays</h3>
                    <p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="reduce_sox_pollution-1.avif" alt="reduce_sox_pollution" width="100%" height="250">
                        </figure>
                        Cruise holidays have become increasingly popular. However, these big ships contribute massively to GHG emissions. Carnival Corporation's fleet of 47 cruise ships emits 10 times more sulphur oxides (SOx) than 100 million cars. <br><br>

                        It is important to be aware of your holiday's footprint on the environment and opt for more sustainable holidays when possible.
                    </p>
                    <h3>4. Electric Cars</h3>
                    <p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="eco-friendly_cars.avif" alt="eco-friendly_cars" width="100%" height="200">
                        </figure>
                        Diesel- and petrol-fuelled cars are major contributors to global warming, mainly due to the amount of CO2 emissions they emit. 27% of the UK's total emissions came from transport in 2019, with 91% from road transport vehicles. <br><br>

                        Electric vehicles are the most sustainable driving method since they don't use traditional fuels. They don't produce any air pollutants from gas, particulates, or air toxics.

            <details>
                <summary>Plant trees and support reforestation efforts:-</summary>Look for local tree-planting events in your area and participate. Consider donating to reforestation projects that plant trees in areas that have been affected by deforestation or other land-use changes. These projects are often run by environmental organisations and can have a significant impact on restoring ecosystems.

                Deforestation accounts for 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
