                   <p>
                      While homes may not pollute as much as corporations do, there are many things you as a homeowner can do to make your home a more eco friendly house. It is important to make a change wherever possible, and your home is something you have control over - so why not make the change? Here is a list of things you can do, from home improvements that require significant up-front capital to small, easy changes that can have a big impact. <br><br>

                      To help the environment, you don't need to go completely off-grid. No matter your budget and lifestyle, there are eco-friendly home improvements that can lessen your carbon footprint, reduce your amount of waste and support the well-being of our planet.

                    <h3>1. Renewable Energy for Electricity</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        Solar photovoltaic (PV) installations convert the sun's energy into electricity using photovoltaic cells or solar panels. This allows you to generate your own reliable, sustainable and low-maintenance source of energy, saving the average UK household one tonne of carbon per year, according to the Energy Saving Trust.Solar PV can also be combined with electric heating systems, such as air source heat pumps, to run your heating and hot water entirely from renewable sources.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Energy Efficient Lighting</h3>

                    <p>
                        Energy-saving light bulbs last up to 12 times as much as traditional bulbs, providing the same light quality for much less energy. 80% of the energy used to power traditional bulbs is lost in heating energy, whereas LED light bulbs run at 80-90% energy efficiency.According to the Energy Saving Trust, they can reduce carbon emissions by up to 40kg annually.

                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Use Eco-Cleaning Products</h3>

                    <p>
                        Many mainstream cleaning products containing detergents, preservatives, or foaming agents are made from various toxic chemicals that wash up into streams and rivers, causing water pollution that enters ecosystems and damages biodiversity.<br>

                        Switching to products that contain sustainably grown or raised ingredients and non-synthetics reduces the risk of exposure to toxic chemicals harmful to humans and the environment. <br><br>

                        You can also easily make your natural cleaners by mixing vinegar, lemon juice and bicarbonate of soda. This sustainable and cheaper alternative reduces toxic chemicals and packaging waste in your home.
                    </p>

                    <h3>4. Biodegradable Household Products</h3>

                    <p>
                        While you cannot control whether or not the products you dispose of will end up being recycled and reused, you can purchase products made of non-synthetic ingredients that are biodegradable to limit the impact of this waste. <br><br>

                        Biodegradable products dissolve due to contact with bacteria and fungi. This means that if they come into contact with nature, they won't cause any environmental harm, as they disappear through natural processes. <br>

                        <pre><b>  These products might include:-</b></pre>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recycled toilet paper</li>
                            <li>Natural ingredient shampoo</li>
                            <li>Natural deodorant</li>
                            <li>Bamboo toothbrush</li>
                            <li>Washcloths made from hemp or agave fibres</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    

                    <h3>5. Double or Triple Glazed Windows</h3>

                    <p>
                       Double-glazed windows have two sheets of glass panels with a gap, and triple-glazed windows have three sheets with two gaps. The gaps keep air or gas (usually argon gas) vacuum-sealed. The gas prevents heat loss since it is a poor thermal conductor, so heat cannot easily pass through it. <br><br>
                       Low-E glass is most effective for preventing heat loss as it has an invisible layer of metal oxide on one internal layer reflecting heat directly inside.

                    <h3>6. Cavity Wall Insulation</h3>

                    <p>
                        In older buildings with cavity walls, an inner and outer wall with an air gap in between, it's a good idea to fit some insulation to optimise your home, especially if you're considering investing in a heat pump. Insulation comes in various types and materials, including wood fibre and polystyrene. <br><br>

                        Insulation boards are best suited to large areas and cavity walls. For keen DIY-ers, this type of insulation is fairly easy to cut and fit yourself. <br><br>

                        Simple Energy Advice says up to 25% of your home's heating energy is lost in the roof. You can stop rising heat from escaping through your loft by laying down blanket loft insulation rolls that you can alter to fit between the joists in your loft. <br> <br>

                        Gaps between older floorboards are inevitable as the wood expands and contracts due to varying air humidity levels. This causes avoidable draughts, which waste your home's heating energy. <br>
                        You can fill these to exclude draughts using dust, resin or acrylic fillers, or wood filler strips, which you can find in most DIY stores.

                <summary>Use Reusable Menstrual Products::-</summary>Conventional menstrual products, such as pads and tampons, contribute to landfill waste and are made from synthetic materials that can be harmful to the environment. Reusable menstrual products, such as menstrual cups and cloth pads, are a more eco-friendly alternative.

            <details>
                <summary>Plant trees and support reforestation efforts:-</summary>Look for local tree-planting events in your area and participate. Consider donating to reforestation projects that plant trees in areas that have been affected by deforestation or other land-use changes. These projects are often run by environmental organisations and can have a significant impact on restoring ecosystems.

                Deforestation accounts for 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
