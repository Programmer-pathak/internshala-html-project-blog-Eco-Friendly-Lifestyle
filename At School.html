                        There are a lot of things that parents can do to ensure that their kids are more environmentally friendly at school. Whether it's walking your kid to school or ensuring that they use environmentally friendly school supplies to minimise the damage done to nature. Inspiring kids to contribute to a greener environment and world is something we could and should do.
                    </p>
                    <h3>1. Make Green Choices to Go to School</h3>
                    <p>
                        As driving emits pollution, parents should consider alternative ways of getting their children to school, whether walking them to school or using public transportation. Using the car less can make a huge difference to the environment in the long run. In some cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam, parents use cargo bikes to ride their children to school, which is a great eco friendly solution to using a car.

                    <h3>2. Use Containers, Not Paper Bags</h3>
                    <p>
                        When making lunch for children to bring to school, parents should invest in reusable lunch boxes instead of giving them food in paper bags to be thrown out. If a food item needs to be wrapped, avoid cling wrap and opt for more environmentally friendly wrapping materials like beeswax.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Invest in Electronic Devices Instead of Paper</h3>
                    <p>
                        As technology adapts to different scenarios, many different products can be used to take notes. Although investing in a laptop or a tablet may be expensive, your child could save time taking notes and help reduce paper waste at school.
