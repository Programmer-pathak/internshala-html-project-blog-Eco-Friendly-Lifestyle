                        <h3>What does it mean to eat for the Environment?</h3>

                        <p>
                            Eating for the environment, or eating sustainably, is about choosing foods that are healthy for your body and the world around you. Sustainable eating patterns help conserve natural resources while also supporting local farms. <br><br>

                            Start by eating a more plant-based diet. This includes eating more legumes (beans, lentils, and peas), whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and fewer animal-based foods, such as red meat and cheese.
                        </p>
    
                        <h3>Can you still eat meat and be Environmentally friendly?</h3>
    
                        <p>
                            The short answer is yes. Eating meat is an important aspect of many cultures, religions, and personal preferences. The first step is to focus on where you buy your meat. Look into joining a local meat CSA (community supported agriculture) or purchase meat from the local farmer's market. These meat purchases can be more expensive, so consider decreasing the amount of meat you eat overall. Instead of making meat the focus of a meal, make it a small part. Fill most of your plate with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. You can also incorporate ‚Äúmeatless Mondays‚Äù each week. <br><br>

                            Every small action makes a difference, so be thoughtful about your food choices and do what feels sustainable for you and your family. <br><br>

                    <h3>1. Eat Less Meat</h3>
                    <p>
                        Meat and dairy are responsible for most GHG emissions in the agriculture industry. <br><br>
                        Emissions occur from the production stage to processing, packaging, and finally being delivered. Farming releases two powerful greenhouse gases: methane from livestock during digestion and nitrous oxide, an indirect product of organic and mineral nitrogen fertilisers. <br><br>
                        As most emissions result from producing and preparing meat and dairy, consuming less meat would reduce GHG emissions. While some opt to drastically change their diets to a vegan one drastically, simply reducing your intake of meat can already have a big impact.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Shop for Local Produce</h3>
                    <p>
                        The average item of fresh food travels 1,500 miles before we buy it. These carbon-heavy value chains create emissions through transport, refrigeration and production processes. <br><br>

                        You can eliminate this by buying from local producers where you can. A well-established local food economy strengthens supply chains, meaning there are more supply options during shortages. Local, seasonal produce also has higher nutritional value since it has spent less time from its source. Meanwhile, international produce is grown to artificially exceed its natural shelf life, which compromises its nutritional value.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Limit Food Waste</h3>
                    <p>
                        In India, 40% of the food wasted is equivalent to nearly 92,000 crore/year. This is equivalent to nearly 1% of the GDP which is depleted in the form of food wastage in India. Each person in India wastes 55 kg of food per year as per UN Environment Programme's report. <br><br>
                        You can limit your household food waste by portioning your meals reasonably, only buying what you need and using food waste as fertiliser for soil and plants.

                <summary>Use Reusable Menstrual Products::-</summary>Conventional menstrual products, such as pads and tampons, contribute to landfill waste and are made from synthetic materials that can be harmful to the environment. Reusable menstrual products, such as menstrual cups and cloth pads, are a more eco-friendly alternative.

                <summary>Plant trees and support reforestation efforts:-</summary>Look for local tree-planting events in your area and participate. Consider donating to reforestation projects that plant trees in areas that have been affected by deforestation or other land-use changes. These projects are often run by environmental organisations and can have a significant impact on restoring ecosystems.

                Deforestation accounts for 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
