                <summary>Use Reusable Menstrual Products::-</summary>Conventional menstrual products, such as pads and tampons, contribute to landfill waste and are made from synthetic materials that can be harmful to the environment. Reusable menstrual products, such as menstrual cups and cloth pads, are a more eco-friendly alternative.

                <summary>Plant trees and support reforestation efforts:-</summary>Look for local tree-planting events in your area and participate. Consider donating to reforestation projects that plant trees in areas that have been affected by deforestation or other land-use changes. These projects are often run by environmental organisations and can have a significant impact on restoring ecosystems.

                Deforestation accounts for 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
